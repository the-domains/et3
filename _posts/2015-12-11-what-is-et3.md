ET3 stands for Evacuated Tube Transport. ET3 is the fastest and most efficient way to travel. It uses well known methods, parts, and technologies. The patented system works by eliminating virtually all friction normally associated with travel. Three basic embodiments range from: low tech low speed systems for local use at speeds below 200 mph; to high tech systems for continental and intercontinental transport up to 4,000 mph or more.
